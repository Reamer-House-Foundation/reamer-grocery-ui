# Reamer Grocery UI
Frontend UI for Reamer grocery app.


# Project Summary:
Money is wasted driving back and forth to the grocery store. We are trying to
solve that problem by tracking what you buy and bring into your home. Consider
the following scenarios:

I am going to the store and I have a recipe in mind and I know I am going to
need Garlic Powder but I think I have it at home. I didn't have it at home and
now the $2.33 cost an extra $3-5 in gas to go back.

I am already driving passed a grocery store so I decide to run in and grab
milk. When I get home I see that I already had them in the fridge. The milk
expired before I could use it all.


Built with angular and bootstrap.
